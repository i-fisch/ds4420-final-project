    Open AIâ€™s trailblazing large language model (LLM), ChatGPT, was first 
    released in November 2022, and has been credited for jump-starting 
    the AI boom. The widespread use of generative AI has affected sectors
    including education, customer service, healthcare, content creation, and 
    more. One strength that ChatGPT and similar AI models have been 
    credited with are their ability to debug code, increasing the 
    efficiency of software engineers, data scientists, and similar professions.
    Because of the wide-ranging effects of ChatGPT and other generative AI 
    models, we wanted to investigate the ways in which they have potentially 
    altered how people interact with pre-existing technologies. Using both time series 
    models and item-item collaborative filtering, we analyzed datasets related to the usage of 
    other technologies to discover how they may have been affected by the rise in LLMs. 
    This website displays some of our investigation and findings from the time series models.
